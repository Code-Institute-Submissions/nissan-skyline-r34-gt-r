# Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R Website

View the live project here.

This is a website for Nissan Skyline R-34 GT-R aficionados. This car is a legend in the worldwide car community. It’s extremely popular with street racers, tuners and car fans around the world, and even in motorsports. It’s every car person’s dream project car. And, if you're of a certain age group (my age group), you grew up playing racing games on PlayStation, watching “The Fast and the Furious” and you were absolutely obsessed with Initial D.

In all three of those franchises, the Nissan Skyline GT-R plays a pivotal role. It was the best car in Gran Turismo 2. Paul Walker drove one in “2 Fast 2 Furious”. And the God Foot was a menace on the mountain. It was a huge deal.

But, strangely, there aren’t many websites specifically dedicated to the Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R, with not just technical information, but also good photos and videos of this specific model (R34). I hope this website helps changing that and is followed by many others.

This website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential R34 fans.
 
## User Experience (UX)

**• User stories**

  **o First-time Visitor Goals**

            a. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand what the website is about, navigate with ease throughout it all and find functional, yet interesting content.

            b. As a first-time visitor, I want to find good, specific and relevant content about the R34: a mix of the car's technical details, good quality photos and informative videos about this specific model, all in one website.

  **o Returning Visitor Goals**

            a. As a returning visitor, and because this is a website for car fans, who tend to visit the same car websites regularly for different purposes (because they're working on a preoject car and they need detailed information about a specific model or parts, or ideas based on the R34's style and features for their own car, which is information that needs to be constantly accessed depending on the project car they're working on, for example), I want to be able to easily access the same good information about the R34 that I accessed the first time I visited the website and that impressed me so much.

  **o Frequent User Goals**

            a. As a frequent user, I want this information to be available at all times so I can access it whenever I need it and show it to other R34 aficionados in my local car community and car fans in general - spreading good car information is what car people do when they meet other gearheads, and websites like this are a good source of car knowledge.

**• Design**

  **o Colour Scheme**

            a. The two main colors used are white (as the background color, just like in most car websites, where the many images tend to be very colorful and big and can be better looked at with a neutral, but bright background) and black (the text color, which makes it easier to read all the technical text when the background color is white). Being neutral colors, they bring teh user's attention to the photos, which are one of the main reasons car fans viist car websites.

  **o Typography**

            a. The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
  **o Imagery**

            a. Images are crucial. Car website are visually appealing, and what the user of such websites visits one, what he/she wants to look at mostly is the car images. There's a different photo of the R34 separating each section of the website, and a gallery with many others.

## Features

    • Responsive on all device sizes

    • Interactive elements

    • Navigation Bar

      o Featured at the top of the scrolling single-page, the fully responsive navigation/link bar introduces the user to all the specific content on the website by showing links to the Home section, the History section, the Specs section, the Powertrain section, the Gallery section, the Videos section and the About section. It's a sticky navigation/link bar, so it follows the user's viewport as he/she scrolls down the long single-page, allowing the user to easily navigate through the content across all devices without having to go back to the top of the page to access other sections.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The Home section

      o The Home section works as the landing page, which includes a beautiful photo of an R34 in South Africa, at the top of a hill, with an entire city in the background and with some text stating the car model and a catching phrase to allow the user to see what the website is about.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The History section

      o A brief history of the Nissan Skyline GT-R throughout the years. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The Specs section

      o The car’s detailed technical specifications – the language spoken by every car fan in the world. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The Powertrain section

      o The content of this page explains the assembly of every component that pushes the car forward, like the transmission, the driveshaft, the axles, the differential, etc., with a specific section just for the engine, the Nissan RB26DETT. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The Gallery section

      o Quality photos of the R34 that I found online. A classic section – and a must in any car website.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The Videos section

      o We’re in the video era and, when it comes to the automotive industry, this kind of visual content became specifically important. The videos on this page are four very good reviews of the R34 on YouTube by Throttle House, Top Gear, Donut Media and Speedhunters, all of them respected car channels with a great presence online – these videos are iFramed on this page.

      (Screenshot here)

    • The About section

      o On this page, I briefly introduce myself, explain what the website aims to accomplish and acknowledge the contribution of several sources to this website. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website.

    • Footer

      o The footer section includes a “Copyright © 2022 Pedro Ferreira” notice – it’s shown on every page of the website. It's a sticky footer, so it follows the user's viewport as he/she scrolls down the long single-page.

## Features Left to Implement

    • A “Comments” section (not added now because this website is to be created using HTML and CSS only, not JavaScript).

    • The reason why this website doesn't have seven different pages and the navigation bar links to specific sections of the scrolling single-page instead is because it follows the usual model for car websites (for desktop or mobile devices), and it works better in mobile devices. This is also the reason why background images were not used (as text, with an overlay effect for better reading, would look too small on mobile devices). This was the original idea (the links to the wireframes are on the "Wireframes" section of this README.md file), which also included an image background change effect on the every page (the background image changes every few seconds – it’s dynamic content), but it wasn’t added now because this website is to be created using HTML and CSS only, not JavaScript.
